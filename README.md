This bot is what controls the @Points-Thing bot on the sndevs.com workspace.

## What is Points-Thing?

On the SNDevs workspace, we like to give kudos to each other! Especially when someone has been particularly helpful (answered a ServiceNow question, helped review a code snippet, or simply pointed to the right documentation) or even when someone provided a much needed laugh (a funny joke, a well-timed meme, or simple relatable musings).

To give those kudos, we made the Points-Thing bot! Simply @ mention someone and put ++ right after to give them a point.

`@AbelTuter ++`

And the bot keeps track (via a ServiceNow instance) of how helpful that person has been. Now user can quickly see who in the community has been a great contributor. And contributors have a way to show credibility in their responses.

The bot evolved from there and functionality has been added onto it ever since it was created in 2017.

## To set up:

1. Fork this repo
2. Go to your ServiceNow instance
3. Go to `System Applications` => `Studio`
4. Once Studio loads, select `Import From Source Control`
5. Use your forked repo to [Import your application](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/learn/learning-plans/tokyo/new_to_servicenow/app_store_learnv2_devenvironment_tokyo_importing_an_application_from_source_control)
6. See below on how to get this bot working on your own server
7. Make updates to the application (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional details)
8. In Studio, commit your changes to source control
9. Submit a pull request to the ServiceNowDevProgram/Points-Thing `main` branch

An accepted Pull Request and merge does not necessarily mean the functionality will go live immediately, as an admin for the host instance will need to pull the application into ServiceNow.
